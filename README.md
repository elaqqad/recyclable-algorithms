# recyclable-algorithms

This repository attempts to provide a simple, easily modifiable and reusable version of well known and less known algorithms. An algorithm is accepted in this repository if :
[*] It relies only on basic and common libraries (No third parties)
[*] It can be used directly without any need to perform any setup
[*] It's as simple as possible, so that anyone can understand and modify it
